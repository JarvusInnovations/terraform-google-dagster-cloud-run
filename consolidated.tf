# Consolidated single-instance Dagster deployment (minimal cost floor / "rung 1").
#
# Runs the webserver (ingress), daemon, and code server as three containers in ONE
# always-on Cloud Run Service instance, for a single code location.
#
# Created only when var.deployment_mode == "consolidated". In that mode the split
# webserver Service, daemon Worker Pool, and code-server Service are not created.
#
# Key constraints (see README "Deployment modes"):
#   - max_instance_count = 1: the daemon must be a singleton. A second instance
#     would double-fire schedules and double-evaluate sensors.
#   - cpu_idle = false (instance-based billing): in a request-billed Service,
#     sidecars only receive CPU while the ingress container is handling a request,
#     which would starve the always-on daemon between UI requests. Always-allocated
#     CPU is required for the daemon to tick reliably.
#   - Inter-container traffic is over localhost. The code server listens on its
#     configured port (3030, matching the consumer's workspace.yaml); the webserver and
#     daemon reach it at CODE_SERVER_HOST_<LOC> = "localhost". No separate internal
#     code-server Service is created, and no gRPC traffic leaves the instance.
#   - Run workers are unaffected: they are still launched per-run as Cloud Run Jobs
#     by the CloudRunRunLauncher (see run_worker.tf).
